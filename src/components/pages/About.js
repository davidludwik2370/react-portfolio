        My name is David Ludwik and I am a junior full stack software developer and soon to be graduate of the Georgia Tech full stack web 
        development coding bootcamp. My original degree is in biology, but I have a long history of coding ever since my first cs class in highschool.
        Over the years I have written a number of applications that do various things, usually of a mathematical nature. Such projects include a sudoku solver and an
        unbeatable tic-tac-toe ai.
